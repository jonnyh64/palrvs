#
# Yet another implementation of the venerable Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm
#
# Used papers for the implementation of class QuineMcCluskeyAlgorithm:
# [1] The Problem of Simplifying Truth Functions
#     W. V. Quine
#     The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 59, No. 8 (Oct., 1952),
#     pp. 521-531
# [2] ALGEBRAIC MINIMIZATION AND THE DESIGN OF TWO-TERMINAL CONTACT NETWORKS
#     EDWARD JOSEPH McCLUSKEY, JR.
#     SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF
#     DOCTOR OF SCIENCE at the MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
#     June, 1956
#
# Basic properties of this particular implementation:
# - The "mechanical routine" described under "Theorem 4" in [1] is used as
#   the core algorithm to to find the prime implicants
# - After finding the prime implicants, a table similar to what is described
#   under "Theorem 5" in [1] is constructed, but for selecting the
#   necessary prime implicants, "Petrick's method" is used, see below
# - Apart from the prime implicant table idea, "Theorems 5-8" in [1] are
#   unused
# - Only minterms are accepted as input ([1] calls this "developed
#   normal form", [2] calls this "standard sum"; in the BSTJ version of
#   his paper, McCluskey calls this "canonical expansion")
# - The program code does not use any symbols (like letters) for processing,
#   but relies on binary representation of minterms, as suggested in [2]
# - In particular, section "1.3 Prime Implicants" in [2] is followed
#   to find the prime implicants via binary representations of terms
# - The minterms are NOT ordered in groups of ascending number of "1" bits,
#   as suggested in [2] ("It is expedient to order these binary numbers so
#   that any numbers which contain no 1's come first, followed by any
#   numbers containing a single 1, etc."); reason: for following the
#   algorithm with pencil and paper, this ordering seems indeed "expedient",
#   but on a computer, the required sorting causes an overhead and it seems
#   at least unclear if this is computationally cheaper than simply comparing
#   all terms to each other
# - Similar to above, apart from the basic prime implicant table idea,
#   sections "1.4 Prime Implicant Tables" to "1.7 Cyclic Prime Implicant
#   Tables and Group Invariance" in [2] are unused
# - Support for the Section "1.8 Phi-Terms" is included, but the terms are
#   named "don't care terms", which seems the more common name in 2025
# - Only the prime implicants are computed according to above papers, for
#   further processing, "Petrick's method" is used, see below
#
# Supposedly used paper for the implementation of class PetricksMethod:
# [3] A Direct Determination of the Irredundant Forms of a Boolean Function
#     from the Set of Prime Implicants
#     S. R. Petrick
#     Air Force Cambridge Research Center. AFCRC Technical Report TR-56-110.
#
# The author was unable to find the original paper [3] on the Internet
# to check if the implemented algorithm matches it and instead relied on
# what it described at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrick%27s_method
#

#
# Measure of simplicity:
# - [1] says: "Limiting ourselves to normal formulas, we still have some choice
#   as to our measure of simplicity. We might simply count all occurrences of
#   literals and alternation signs, or we might put a premium on fewness of
#   clauses and so resort to a count of occurrences of literals only when
#   comparing formulas which are alike in number of clauses. What I shall have
#   to say in this paper will not require any decision, however, between these
#   or other reasonable standards of simplicity."
# - [2] says: "The sum functions which have the fewest terms of all equivalent
#   sum functions will be called minimum sums unless these functions having
#   fewest terms do not all involve the same number of literals. In such cases,
#   only those functions which involve the fewest literals will be called
#   minimum sums."
# This implementation follows [2] regarding what is regarded as "minimum" and
# also refers to this as "simplest".
#

#
# Handling of edge cases this particular implementation:
# - If a boolean expression is always true, the Python boolean value "True"
#   is returned as result ([1] calls such formulas "valid")
# - If a boolean expression is always false, the Python boolean value "False"
#   is returned as result ([1] calls such formulas "inconsistent")
#

#
# Implementation of "dashes" as used in [2]:
# - For each implicant, a "mask" is stored; for each variable in the implicant,
#   this mask contains - in the bit position of the variable - either a 1 bit
#   bit indicating that this variable is relevant or a 0 bit indicating that
#   this variable has been replaced with a dash in the process of combining
#   terms
# - This mask is also kept when the simplest results are returned
# - Example: When a product "A*B*C" is expressed as bit pattern 0b111, the bit
#   pattern 0b1x1 with mask 0b101 would refer to the product "A*C", as "B"
#   has been eliminated by the algorithm
